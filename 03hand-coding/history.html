        <h1>History of Music</h1>
        <h2>Every Note Has a Past</h2>
        <p>The history of music stretches back thousands of years, reflecting the story of human creativity and emotion. Early music began with simple rhythms, vocal chants, and instruments made from natural materials like bones, shells, and wood. In ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Greece, and China, music played an important role in ceremonies, storytelling, and entertainment. These early sounds laid the foundation for the musical systems and scales that would shape the future of music around the world.</p>
        <p>During the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods, music became more structured and written down, especially within churches. Composers began to develop harmonies and more complex melodies, leading to the rise of classical traditions. By the 1600s and 1700s, the Baroque and Classical eras brought elegant, emotional compositions from legends like Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven. Music moved from royal courts into concert halls, becoming an art form that celebrated beauty, balance, and human expression.</p>
        <p>As time went on, the 19th and 20th centuries saw rapid evolution and experimentation. The Romantic era added passion and drama, while the 1900s introduced jazz, blues, rock, pop, and hip-hop—each born from cultural shifts and technological advances. With the invention of recording and streaming, music became more accessible than ever before, allowing artists from every corner of the world to share their voices. From ancient drums to digital beats, the history of music is a journey of innovation, emotion, and connection that continues to shape our lives today.</p>
