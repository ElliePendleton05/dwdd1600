        <h1>Eras of Music</h1>
        <h2>Every Era Has its Own Rhythm</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Classical</dt>
            <dd>The Classical music era, which lasted from about 1750 to 1820, was a time of elegance, balance, and structure in music. Composers like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Franz Joseph Haydn created works that emphasized clarity, harmony, and emotional expression within organized forms. This period saw the rise of the symphony, sonata, and concerto, as well as the growth of the orchestra. Unlike the dramatic style of the Baroque era before it, Classical music focused on simplicity and beauty, aiming to please the ear and evoke feeling through graceful melodies and refined compositions that still inspire musicians today.</dd>
            <dt>Jazz</dt>
            <dd>The Jazz music era began in the early 1900s and became one of the most influential movements in music history. Originating in New Orleans, jazz blended African rhythms, blues, and ragtime to create a new, expressive sound full of improvisation and emotion. Musicians like Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Ella Fitzgerald brought jazz to life with creativity and soul, shaping the sound of the Roaring Twenties and beyond. The genre evolved through styles like swing, bebop, and cool jazz, each adding its own flavor. More than just music, the jazz era represented freedom, innovation, and cultural change—leaving a lasting impact that continues to inspire artists today.</dd>
            <dt>Disco & Pop</dt>
            <dd>The Disco and Pop music era, mainly during the 1970s and 1980s, was a time of vibrant energy, dance floors, and unforgettable hits. Disco emerged first, with its funky basslines, steady beats, and glittering style that encouraged people to dance the night away in clubs. Artists like the Bee Gees, Donna Summer, and Gloria Gaynor became icons of the disco scene. As the '80s arrived, pop music took center stage with catchy hooks, electronic sounds, and bold fashion. Stars like Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Prince defined the decade, blending style and sound into global sensations. Together, the disco and pop eras celebrated fun, freedom, and self-expression—creating music that still makes people want to move today.</dd>
