        <h1>Genres</h1>
        <h2>Genres of Music</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Pop</dt>
            <dd>Pop music is one of the most popular and influential genres in the world, known for its catchy melodies, upbeat rhythms, and relatable lyrics. It's designed to appeal to a wide audience, often blending elements from other styles like rock, hip-hop, and electronic music. Pop songs usually focus on universal themes such as love, friendship, and self-expression, making them easy for listeners to connect with. Over the years, artists like Taylor Swift, Michael Jackson, and Ariana Grande have shaped the sound of pop, keeping it fresh and ever-evolving. With its constant innovation and wide reach, pop music continues to define the soundtrack of modern life.</dd>
            <dt>Country</dt>
            <dd>Country music is a genre deeply rooted in storytelling, emotion, and tradition. It often features instruments like the guitar, banjo, fiddle, and harmonica, creating a warm and distinctive sound. The lyrics typically reflect real-life experiences—love, heartbreak, hard work, and the beauty of simple living. Originating in the rural South of the United States, country music has grown to include modern influences from pop and rock while still holding onto its heartfelt core. Artists like Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, and Luke Combs have helped shape the genre, keeping its spirit alive for new generations of listeners.</dd>
            <dt>Rap</dt>
            <dd>Rap music is a powerful genre that focuses on rhythm, wordplay, and expression. It's built around spoken or chanted lyrics—often called “bars”—delivered over a beat or instrumental track. Originating in the streets of the Bronx in the 1970s, rap quickly became a voice for storytelling, social commentary, and self-empowerment. The genre often highlights real-life struggles, cultural pride, and personal success, making it both artistic and impactful. Artists like Tupac Shakur, Jay-Z, and Kendrick Lamar have shaped rap into one of the most influential forms of modern music, blending creativity, poetry, and emotion in every verse.</dd>
